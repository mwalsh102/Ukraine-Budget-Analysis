This script takes municipal-level budget data in Ukraine from 2021 (pre-war) and 2022 (post-war) and creates two interactive charts using the folium library in Python. One is a map documenting spatial differences in revenues across Ukraine. The other analyzes changes in spending across municipalities based on whether they gained revenue windfalls during the war or lost revenue due to internal emigration.
